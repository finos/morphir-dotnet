## [0.0.1-alpha-006] - 2023-04-19

This marks the first release of the project. The Morphir IR has been ported from the
[morphir-elm](https://github.com/finos/morphir-elm) project and required codecs should be in place.

We are still working on the CLI tool and the Morphir SDK and the project is still very much in its early days.
