Feature: Refuse computation, sequence and comprehension expressions and arrays
  Morphir has no builders, lazy sequences or arrays. See the fsharp-source-
  frontend spec and the rule catalog.

  Scenario Outline: frontend-fsharp-0020 A sequence expression has a precise refusal
    Given the F# package "acme/demo" exposing "Pricing"
    And the source "Pricing.fs":
      """fsharp
      namespace Acme.Demo
      module Pricing =
          let days = seq { yield 3 }
      """
    When it is compiled from <input> with IR version <version>
    Then compilation fails with diagnostics:
      """json
      [{"severity":"error","code":"fsharp.unsupported_sequence_expression","location":{"uri":"Pricing.fs","range":{"start":{"line":2,"character":19},"end":{"line":2,"character":30}}}}]
      """

    Examples:
      | input        | version |
      | files        | 1       |
      | files        | 2       |
