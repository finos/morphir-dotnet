Feature: Refuse every other construct outside the supported subset
  A construct that no specific rule names is still refused, so lowering only
  sees admitted syntax. See the fsharp-source-frontend spec and the rule
  catalog.

  Scenario Outline: frontend-fsharp-0090 A lazy expression has the expression refusal
    Given the F# package "acme/demo" exposing "Pricing"
    And the source "Pricing.fs":
      """fsharp
      namespace Acme.Demo
      module Pricing =
          let later = lazy 40
      """
    When it is compiled from <input> with IR version <version>
    Then compilation fails with diagnostics:
      """json
      [{"severity":"error","code":"fsharp.unsupported_expression","location":{"uri":"Pricing.fs","range":{"start":{"line":2,"character":16},"end":{"line":2,"character":23}}}}]
      """

    Examples:
      | input        | version |
      | files        | 1       |
      | files        | 2       |
